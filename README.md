## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I don't think I learned anything new because I already had theoretical knowledge among the techniques used, but the project was cool to practice my coding skills, mainly CSS Flexbox.

I'm proud that I added comments to organize the CSS a little better (compared to the last qr-code project). 

Also I tried to use the CSS multiselector to compress the styling code.

### Continued development

I'm a little more confortable with basic flexbox, but I believe that with the next projects this should improve more.
